# This is another test!

This is going to be deleted but in case someone peeps back the commit history here's what's going on. I used to have [yev.app](https://yev.app) be my acting CDN for the blogs and then I decided that it'd be better to simply use GitHub for storing [blogs](https://github.com/yevbar/blogs) and more :)

Peace,
Yev
